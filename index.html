	<p>I am a PPE PhD candidate/Junior lecturer at the <a href="https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/john-stuart-mill-college">John Stuart Mill College</a>, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My research (supervised by <a href="http://personal.vu.nl/j.r.vanden.brink/">Prof. Dr. René van den Brink</a> and <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/martin-van-hees">Prof. Dr. Martin van Hees</a>) lies at the intersection of philosophy and economics and concerns—conceptual, methodological, and normative—issues of social power. For these and other issues I think and write about (often, with co-authors), I use game theory, social networks, and social choice theory. The history of economic and philosophical thought are two areas of, if not specialisazation, then fascination—there, I try to keep up and learn from others as best one can.</p>
		
		<p>I am also one of the editors of the <a href="https://www.ejpe.org/journal"><cite>Erasmus Journal for Philosophy and Economics</cite></a>—completely open-access and with an expressed commitment to fostering the work of junior scholars.</p>
