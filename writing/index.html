	<p>My writing currently spans the following topics: the measurement of power in hierarchical structures (with my supervisor <a href="http://personal.vu.nl/j.r.vanden.brink/">René van den Brink</a>), conceptions of republican domination (with <a href="https://www.stefanomerlo.org/">Stefano Merlo</a>), bankruptcy problems and how cooperative game theory should deal with them (with <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/roland-iwan-luttens">Roland Luttens</a>), the demands of morality (with <a href="https://www.benjaminferguson.org/">Ben Ferguson</a>), the demands of rationality (with <a href="https://akshathjitendranath.weebly.com/">Akshath Jitendranath</a>), and the history and philosophy of measuring power. See below for the published work, including final drafts. An ongoing, and quite long-term, project is the history and philosophy of measuring (voting) power in cooperative game theory. Always open to hearing from folks interested in this as well.</p>
