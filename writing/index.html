	<p>My writing currently spans the following topics: the measurement of power in hierarchical structures (with my supervisor <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/jr-van-den-brink">René van den Brink</a>), conceptions of republican domination (with <a href="https://www.stefanomerlo.org/">Stefano Merlo</a>), bankruptcy problems and how cooperative game theory should deal with them (with <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/roland-iwan-luttens">Roland Luttens</a>), the demands of morality (with <a href="https://www.benjaminferguson.org/">Ben Ferguson</a>), the demands of rationality (with <a href="https://akshathjitendranath.weebly.com/">Akshath Jitendranath</a>), and the history and philosophy of measuring power.

	Abstract: We consider two decision-making models on strict hierarchies: a binary (‘yes’/‘no’) model and a ternary extension that, additionally, allows for abstention. Our interest is in comparing the voting power of the agents in a hierarchical organisation across these two models. In order to do that, we define and axiomatise two voting power measures on strict hierarchies inspired by the Penrose-Banzhaf measure and corresponding to the two models. Our conclusion is that allowing for the possibility to not commit to a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision, and to instead delegate this decision to another agent, is empowering. What is more, the larger an organisation is, the more empowering this possibility is: as a hierarchical organisation expands, the possibility of abstention empowers subordinate agents in an exponential way.</p>

	Abstract: We consider transfer and merge invariance properties in the measurement of political power in majority voting situations where the political parties/players are ordered linearly. This order may be based on, for example, ideology or political preferences over economic policy, ethical principles, environmental issues, and so on. A transfer refers to some members/seats of one party moving to one of its neighbouring parties. A merge refers to two neighbouring parties merging into one party with its set of members being the union of the sets of members of the two separate parties, and thus the number of seats being the sum of the number of seats of the two original parties. In both cases, invariance refers to this transfer, respectively merge, having no effect on the power of the other parties. We show that the unique transfer invariant, unanimous, Core stable power index is the hierarchical index (based on the hierarchical outcomes of Demange (2002)), while the unique merge invariant, unanimous, Core stable power index is the \(\tau\)-index (based on the \(\tau\)-value of Tijs (1981)).</p>

	Abstract: The existence of acts that are supererogatory—acts that are morally optional and morally better than another available morally permissible act—conflicts with the conjunction of two plausible claims about moral goodness, reasons, and moral permissions. The first, moral continence, claims that if there are strictly stronger moral reasons to \(\phi\) than there are to \(\psi\), then ψ-ing is morally impermissible. The second, the very weak classical view, claims that if act \(\phi\) is morally better than act \(\psi\), then there is a stronger moral reason to \(\phi\) than to \(\psi\). </br> The most common response to this tension is to abandon moral continence and to thus claim that it can be morally permissible to perform acts that are less well supported by moral reasons. This paper considers three leading challenges to moral continence and argues that none succeed. We conclude that supererogation should either be accommodated by rejecting the weak classical view, or the intuitions that support the existence of supererogation should be dissolved via an error theory.</p>
