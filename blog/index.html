	<p>Here, I collect reflections on various readings, the goal being one paper per month—though, as a casual glance may attest, some months tend to indecently stretch into two and others yet more rudely into a year.</p>
	<ul class="posts">
	  {% for post in site.posts %}
	    <li><span><section>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</section></span> <bullet>»</bullet> <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
	  {% endfor %}
	</ul>
