<p>Anders Herlitz (2020). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266267119000026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stable and unstable choices</a>. <cite>Economics & Philosophy</cite> 36 (1): 113–125.</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;"><cite>John’s ice-cream</cite>: “Consider a variation of a joke retold by Larry Temkin: imagine a man, John, who enters an ice-cream parlour and proclaims: ‘I’ll have the strawberry, unless I’ve already chosen that – in which case I’ll go for chocolate! But if I’ve chosen chocolate, then I’ll have the strawberry!’ (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199759446.001.0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temkin</a> 2012: 388). John appears to be irrational. He clearly wants strawberry ice-cream, but as soon as he has chosen it he does not want it any longer. Yet when he has changed his mind, he is again unsatisfied with his choice and wants to go back to strawberry. This paper presents a general condition that reflects the intuition that John is irrational and that explains why his behaviour is irrational.” (113)</p>

<p>By recalling the joke, Anders Herlitz invites us to focus not on the question whether John’s behaviour is irrational but, granting that it is, on the question why: what is it that makes John’s cylcing through the strawberry-chocolate-strawbery vertigo an instance of irrational behaviour? After discarding a number of candidates, the paper offers just such an explanation. In its shortest form, it claims that</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">“it is irrational to accept a normative theory or a decision method that implies
that the act of choosing a maximal alternative alone can revert whether this choice is maximal or not according to the theory.” (114)</p>

<p>And, more precisely, John’s behaviour is irrational because it follows a decision method that violates a novel, in Herlitz’ words,‘stability condition’. It is an interesting proposal; understanding it, however, requires some heavy preliminary reconstruction work. </p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">Reconstructing Herlitz’ argument</p>

<p>Herlitz’ starting point is that the features of an alternative that are relevant to how it is evaluated by a theory or method should be (explicitly, one may add) <cite>individuated</cite>. For example, if according to a utlitarian theory, the relevant ground for choice is ‘(maximum) utility’, then the utilities resulting from going for each alternative should be explicitly individuated.</p>

<p>First some preliminaries. Suppose that \(X\) is the universal set of alternatives and let \(\mathcal{P}\) be the set of all (for simplicity, non-empty) subsets of \(X\); that is, the set of all possible agendas. (I set aside the question of whether all agendas are feasible as it is not central to Herlitz’ discussion.) A choice function \(C: \mathcal{P} \rightarrow X\) such that \(C(A) \subseteq A\) for all \(A \in \mathcal{P}\) tells us which element (or elements) of an agenda \(A\) has been chosen. Herlitz restricts his discussion to single-valued choice functions so let us add the restriction: \(|C(A)|=1\) for all \(A \in \mathcal{P}\).</p>

<p>The key concept in Herlitz’ paper is that of transmutation. The actual definition is unwieldy:</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">“A transmutation\(_{X}\) of an alternative, \(Y\), in a set of alternatives, \(C\), of which both \(X\) and \(Y\) are elements, into a transmuted\(_{X}\) alternative, \(Y_{X}\), is the transmutation of \(Y\) that appears in the choice set, \(C_{X}\), that is the set of alternatives \(C\) in which the negative and positive values associated with choosing \(X\) have been dispersed across the alternatives in \(C\).” (117)</p>

<p>It is possible to reconstruct this definition in a more clear and precise form. The idea underlying transmutation is that once a choice has been made alternatives are transformed in some way. Suppose that the agenda \(A\) includes two alternatives, \(A = \{x, y\}\), and that the agent chooses \(x\). This then transform the agenda into \(A_{x} = \{x_{x}, y_{x}\}\). These new alternatives are still the old alternatives but with frills: they now include information about any negative or positive values accruing to them in the process of choosing. We can thus think of transmutation as another mapping—from the set of available options in an agenda to a bundle of two alternatives: \(T_{C(A)}: \mathcal{P} \rightarrow X \times X\) with the restriction that</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">\(T_{C(A)}(A) = \{(z, w) | z \in A \text{ and } \{w\} = C(A)\} \text{ for all } A \in \mathcal{P}\)</p>
