<p>Brian Hedden (2020). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/708535" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consequentialism and collective action</a>. <cite>Ethics</cite> 130 (4): 530–554.</p>

<p>Collective action problems are commonly problems of Nash reasoning: if everyone (or most people) did <strong>not</strong> do \(x\), everyone would be better off; and yet, a single person <strong>not</strong> doing \(x\) does not make much of a difference. Brian Hedden calls such acts \(exceptional\) acts because “the term is supposed to evoke the idea that in performing such an act, one seems to be making an exception for oneself” (531).</p>

<p>(To be more precise, this is just one subfamily of the larger family of collective action problems—namely, that of <cite>negative</cite> externalities, the canonical example being pollution; the other subfamily is that of <cite>positive</cite> externalities, the canonical example being the provision of a public good. Whether these two subfamilies are symmetric—and hence whether treating one subfamily entails treating the other—is a question I will bracket here and simply assume, with Hedden, that the argument applies to collective action problems plagued by negative externalities, rather than to collective action problems in general.)</p>

<p>The question in the background of this paper is then: Does consequentialism permit exceptional acts (and hence have undesirable action-guiding implications in collective action problems)? Consequentialists say (typically) no, critics say (typically) yes. Hedden takes two prominent consequentialist defenses:</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">“First, in triggering cases, the exceptional act is impermissible because it has submaximal expected value. It has a high probability of making things slightly worse, or a low probability of making things much worse, or something in between, but in any case its expected value will be lower than that of not performing the exceptional act. Second, all collective action problems are triggering cases.” (531–532)</p>

<p>For each of these defenses, Hedden comes up with novel objections (or rather novel revisions of existing objections) and then argues that these objections fail. This, ultimately, should be good news for the consequentialist. Here, I will focus on the second consequentialist defense and Hedden’s subsequent objection and counter-objection.</p>
