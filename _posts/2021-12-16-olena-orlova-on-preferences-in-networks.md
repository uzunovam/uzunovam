<p>Olena Orlova (2022). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geb.2021.10.006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Idiosyncratic preferences in games on networks</a>. <cite>Games and Economic Behavior</cite> 131: 29–50.</p>

<p>How do our social connections—or, more generally, the structure of our social networks—influence how we make decisions? The dominant approach in the theory of networks takes this to be a question <cite>exclusively</cite> about network effects. On this view, what we (optimally) do is a function of an underlying network structure: my preferences over coffee and tea, say, depend on the choice of beverage that my friends, or acquaintances, make as well as on how much, and <cite>in what way</cite>, I care about these social connections. If I like my friends, for example, then the more <cite>they</cite> drink coffee, the more likely <cite>I</cite> may be to (optimally) drink coffee as well—our actions, in this case, would be <cite>strategic complements</cite>. Alternatively, if I dislike my friends, the more they drink coffee, the more likely I may be to go for tea—a situation of <cite>strategic substitutes</cite>.</p>

<p>Understanding the network effects of individual decision making is immensely important but focusing <cite>only</cite> on these effects is a different matter. Such an approach, as Olena Orlova points out, ultimately assumes that the only source of heterogeneity between agents—relevant to decision making, that is—is that of their network position. Such an approach thus abstracts away from any non-network-related differences in our preferences. My choice of beverage may be a function of my friends’ drinking habits, but it may also depend, in part, on my (exogenously given) preferences over coffee and tea. (One may be tempted to phrase this distinction as one of personal vs structural heterogeneity, but this is too crude—after all, how a network structure affects an agent’s decision making may vary across agents and may thus carry some personal heterogeneity.) Surprisingly, especially given the history of economic thought, attention to how the unique preferences of agents affect what they do in social networks has been sparse (see the discussion on 31 for some related work; most of the preference-related work has been on ‘strategic network formation’, which deals with how preferences affect the formation, and thus structure, of a network). Analysing the interaction between these two sources of agential heterogeneity is the main contribution of Orlova’s paper.</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;"><u>The motivation</u></p>

<p>To get a sense of this contribution and why it is important, consider the following example. There are five agents, \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\), in a social network that can be illustrated as follows (for now, focus on the left panel; the example is adapted from the one on 38):</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;"><img src="https://uzunovam.github.io/images/graph1.png" /></p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;"><smallcaps>figure 1</smallcaps></p>

<p>Suppose that a link between two agents refers to the existence of a friendship (as the network is undirected, friendship is reciprocal: if \(A\) is friends with \(B\), \(B\) is also friends with \(A\)). For instance, in this network, \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are a close-knit group where every agent is friends with every other agent, while \(C\), clearly the most popular agent, is friends with everyone. Suppose, further, that each agent may do either of two things: (1) drink coffee (indicated in blue), or (2) drink tea (indicated in red). Then consider the situation depicted in the left panel above, where \(B\) and \(C\) drink coffee and \(A\), \(D\), and \(E\) drink tea.</p>

<p>To be able to say something about individual utility in this situation, we need to know how utility is affected by one’s friendship network. Suppose that for each immediate friend who drinks the <cite>same</cite> (<cite>different</cite>) beverage, the respective agent receives a utility of \(1/3\) (\(2/3\)). Thus, in the left network above where agent \(C\) drinks coffee, \(C\)’s utility is \(2/3+1/3+2/3+2/3=7/3\). Conversely, in the right network above where \(C\) drinks tea, \(C\)’s utility is \(1/3+2/3+1/3+1/3=5/3\). Clearly, in the situation where \(A\), \(D\), and \(E\) drink tea while only \(B\) drinks coffee, \(C\) is better off drinking coffee. Notice that, in this example, \(C\) cares more about ‘mis-matching’ her action with those of her friends (‘mis-matching’ has a payoff of \(2/3\), which is bigger than the ‘matching’ payoff of \(1/3\)). We are thus in a game of strategic substitutes. That is, \(C\) is better off drinking coffee in such a situation because most of her friends are drinking tea and \(C\) prefers drinking something different. (\(C\) is friends with everyone but is a bit of a contrarian.)</p>

<p>One drawback of the utility function above is that it is entirely dependent on what Orlova calls ‘interactional utility’: the part of one’s utility function that captures network effects. It ignores however, in Orlova’s words, one’s ‘idiosyncratic utility’: the part of one’s utility function that captures one’s idiosyncratic preferences (here, over coffee and tea). Orlova’s contribution is to combine these two components in an overall utility function that captures both network and idiosyncratic effects.</p>

<p>To appreciate why combining these effects might be important, let’s now distinguish between the actions agents may take (drink coffee or tea) and their exogenously given, idiosyncratic preferences over these actions (prefer coffee or tea). Consider the following variation on the situation above:</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;"><img src="https://uzunovam.github.io/images/graph2.png" /></p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;"><smallcaps>figure 2</smallcaps></p>

<p>Here, the colour of the outline of a node indicates the actions in the respective situation: for example, on the left, it is still the case that \(A\), \(D\), and \(E\) drink tea while \(B\) and \(C\) drink coffee. The colour of the letter in a node now indicates that agent’s idiosyncratic preference: for example, on the left, \(E\) prefers coffee (to tea) while \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) prefer tea (to coffee). Suppose that ‘mis-matching’ still carries a (relative) benefit of \(2/3\) while ‘matching’ yields a (relative) benefit of \(1/3\). But now further suppose that, in any situation where an agent performs the action she prefers, she gets a benefit of \(1/4\) for each of her friends; otherwise, when she does not perform her preferred action, she gets a benefit of zero. When \(C\) drinks coffee (left panel), \(C\)’s utility is \(2/3+1/3+2/3+2/3=7/3\). When \(C\) drinks her preferred beverage, tea (right panel), her utility is \(1/3+2/3+1/3+1/3+4/4=8/3\). And so \(C\) is better off drinking tea.</p>

<p>The important thing to notice here is that interactional and idiosyncratic utility may pull in different directions. \(C\) may be a contrarian but if she cared enough about her idiosyncratic tastes, then she may be better off going for what her friends do if <cite>that</cite> were what she cares about. Alternatively, \(C\) may not have strong beverage preferences—if going for her preferred drink were worth just, say, \(1/12\) per friend, \(C\) would be better off being contrarian and drinking coffee.</p>

<p>Preferences over and choices of beverage are innocent enough, but other contexts reveal how important understanding these interactional effects is. Orlova gives the example of school choice (30): in the illustration above, the agents could be parents who are friends or part of a neighbourhood; their actions could be the school (one of two) they choose for their children and their idiosyncratic preferences could be their preferences over these schools. School choice, especially among tight friendship or neighbourhood networks, has wider segregation effects—understanding when parents in a close network <cite>coordinate</cite> on the same school is essential for understanding how segregation may arise and be maintained. The two, among others, classes of games that Orlova focuses on—coordination games, where agents adopt the same action, and anti-coordination games, where agents choose different actions—are immensely relevant here.</p>

<p>In passing (30n6), Orlova mentions that idiosyncratic preferences may also be interpreted as <cite>identities</cite>. In fact, I think we can go further and interpret the whole model as a model of <cite>identity choice</cite>. The groups, broadly construed, that we decide to become members of depend both on idiosyncratic values we hold and on group effects (say, status or group benefits). Understanding the interaction between these two sources of identification is then helpful for understanding the conditions under which we end up with ‘narrow’ or ‘broad’ (or ‘multiple’) identities. (See Partha Dasgupta and Sanjeev Goyal’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.1628/jite-2019-0025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">model of narrow identities</a> and <a href="https://ejpe.org/journal/issue/view/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this symposium</a> on the paper.) These cases would correspond to coordination and anti-coordination games and so the bridge between Orlova’s model and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-082019-110313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economic literature on identity choice</a> is an easy one to build.</p>

<p>In order to summarise the main insights of Orlova’s paper, and discuss some of its wider implications, we need a couple of preliminaries.</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;"><u>Preliminaries</u></p>

<p>A network, like the one(s) above, is a pair \((N,G)\), where \(N=\{1,\dots,n\}\) is a set of nodes (or agents) and \(G\) is an adjacency matrix indicating the (undirected) links between the agents. Thus, \(G_{ij} \in \{0,1\}\) for all agents \(i,j \in N\), where \(G_{ij}=0\) means that there is no link between \(i\) and \(j\) (above, that they are not friends) and \(G_{ij}=1\) means that there is (above, that they are friends). For example, for the networks we’ve seen so far, we have \(N = \{A,B,C,D,E\}\) and \(G_{Ci} = 1\) for \(i \in \{A,B,D,E\}\). Collect in set \(N_{i}(G) = \{j \in N \ | \ G_{ij}=1\}\) all agents to which \(i\) is connected (above, is friends with) and let \(d_{i}\) denote the cardinality of (the number of members in) this set (above, the number of \(i\)’s friends). For instance, \(N_{C}(G) = \{A,B,D,E\}\) and \(d_{C}=4\). Each agent has one of two actions, denoted by \(x_{i} \in \{0,1\}\), and each agent has a preference for one of the two actions, denoted by \(\theta_{i} \in \{0,1\}\). The vectors \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{\theta}\) denote arbitrary action and preference profiles, respectively. For simplicity, the \(d_{i}\)-tuple \(\mathbf{x}_{N_{i}(G)}\) denotes the actions of \(i\)’s friends under \(\mathbf{x}\).</p>

<p>We can now define the interactional utility function Orlova works with. For any \(i \in N\), it has the following form (32):</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">\(u_{i}(\theta_{i}, x_{i}, \mathbf{x}_{N_{i}(G)}) = \sum_{j \in N_{i}(G)} \left( \delta \cdot \mathbb{1}_{x_{i}=x_{j}} + (1-\delta) \cdot (1 - \mathbb{1}_{x_{i}=x_{j}}) + \lambda \cdot \mathbb{1}_{x_{i}=\theta_{i}} \right)\)</p>

<p>Where \(\delta \in [0,1]\) is the ‘matching’ benefit (and \(1-\delta\) is the ‘mis-matching’ benefit) and \(\lambda \in [0,\infty)\) is the benefit an agent obtains from following their idiosyncratic preference. Here, \(\mathbb{1}_{x_{i}=x_{j}}\) is an indicator function that is equal to one when \(j\)’s action matches \(i\)’s, and zero otherwise. (And so \(1 - \mathbb{1}_{x_{i}=x_{j}}\) is equal to one when \(j\)’s action mis-matches \(i\)’s, and zero otherwise.) Similarly, \(\mathbb{1}_{x_{i}=\theta_{i}}\) is equal to one when \(i\)’s action matches her preference, and zero otherwise. When \(\lambda = 0\), we are in the canonical case where only network effects influence individual utility, while when \(\lambda\neq 0\), we are in the case of interactional utility where idiosyncratic preferences also play a role. Finally, when \(\delta > 1/2\), matching has a bigger (marginal) benefit than mismatching and so we are in the case of strategic complements; conversely, \(\delta < 1/2\) is the case of strategic substitutes. (Recall that, in the example above, we had \(\delta=1/3\) and \(\lambda=1/4\).)</p>

<p>Given this set-up, values for \(\delta\) and \(\lambda\) define distinct games, which is why Orlova refers to a game as \((\delta,\lambda\)). Furthermore, by introducing a tie-breaking rule, we may rule out mixed Nash equilibria, allowing us to focus on pure equilibria. Orlova does just that by requiring that whenever an agent is indifferent between two strategies, she go with her idiosyncratic preference. She calls this refined Nash equilibrium concept a <cite>selfish Nash equilibrium</cite> (32).</p>

<p>There are (at least) two types of situations that are particularly intriguing in this setting. First, equilibria where <cite>all</cite> agents adopt the same action—in Orlova’s words, these are <cite>homogeneous equilibria</cite> (otherwise, they are called <cite>heterogeneous</cite>). Second, equilibria where <cite>all</cite> agents adopt the action that coincides with their idiosyncratic preference—in Orlova’s words, these are <cite>fully satisfying equilibria</cite> (otherwise, they are called <cite>frustrating</cite>). For instance, in <smallcaps>figure 2</smallcaps>, both action profiles (on the left and right) are heterogeneous (since both actions, drink coffee and tea, are chosen by some agents) and frustrating (since there are some agents who do not adopt the action matching their preference). Conversely, the following figure illustrates (1) a homogeneous (and frustrating) action profile on the left, and (2) a fully satisfying (and heterogenous) action profile on the right. (Clearly, when agents have heterogenous (homogeneous) idiosyncratic preferences, a homogeneous (heterogenous) profile cannot be fully satisfying and a fully satisfying profile cannot be homogeneous (heterogenous).)</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;"><smallcaps>figure 3</smallcaps></p>



<p style="padding-left:100px;"><u>Coordination games</u></p>
<p>Consider first the case of <cite>coordination games</cite> where \(1/2 < \delta \leq 1\) and \(0 < \lambda < 2\delta -1\) (33). That is, in such games, (1) the matching benefit \(\delta\) is stronger than the mismatching benefit \(1-\delta\) and (2) the stronger the matching benefit \(\delta\) is (the closer it is to one), the wider the admissible range of idiosyncratic benefits \(\lambda\) is (conversely, the weaker \(\delta\) is, the smaller the admissible range of \(\lambda\) is). Notice, in particular, that \(2\delta - 1\) is the (least) upper bound of the idiosyncratic benefit—in other words, for a game to be a coordination game, on this definition, the strength of the idiosyncratic benefit should be bounded from above by the strength of the matching benefit. Consider the five-agent network illustrated so far, which we may describe by its degree distribution, that is, the distribution of connections (above, friends) that each player has. In our example, we have agents with a degree of \(1\) (agents \(D\) and \(E\)), \(2\) (agents \(A\) and \(B\)), and \(4\) (agent \(C\)). Notice that an agent’s utility here depends on how many of her neighbours perform the same action as she does and whether that action is her <cite>preferred</cite> action. Call an agent’s neighbour who performs her preferred action her <cite>companion</cite> (33). For example, in the left panel of <smallcaps>figure 2</smallcaps>, \(D\) is \(C\)’s companion (but not vice versa, so companionship is not symmetric). We may then ask what the conditions for certain optimal actions are by first asking the following question: for a player \(i\) with a given degree \(d_{i}\), what is the minimum number of companions for the agent’s preferred action to be her optimal response? Notice that if we are interested in fully satisfying equilibria (where everyone performs her preferred action), the answer to this question is crucial. The answer for an arbitrary degree \(d_{i}\) is stated in Lemma 1 (36) and denoted by \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(d_{i})\). Here, we may apply the lemma to our five-agent network.</p>

<p>Consider, first, the agents of degree \(1\) (agents \(D\) and \(E\)). For arbitrary \(\delta\) and \(\lambda\) that satisfy the coordination-game conditions, the minimum number of companions such agents need for their preferred action to be optimal is given by:</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(1) \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(1) = \lambda + 2 \delta - 1\) when \((2\delta -1)\frac{1-2(2\delta-1)}{1+2(2\delta-1)} \leq \lambda < 2\delta-1\) (that is, when \(\lambda\) is ‘sufficiently close’ to its upper bound);</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(2) \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(1) = \lambda + 2 \delta\) when \(0 < \lambda < (2\delta -1)\frac{1-2(2\delta-1)}{1+2(2\delta-1)}\) (that is, when \(\lambda\) is ‘sufficiently smaller’ than its upper bound).</p>

<p>For agents of degree \(2\) (agents \(A\) and \(B\)), we have:</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(1) \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(2) = \lambda\) when \((2\delta -1)\frac{1}{2\delta} \leq \lambda < 2\delta-1\) (that is, when \(\lambda\) is ‘sufficiently close’ to its upper bound);</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(2) \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(2) = \lambda + 1\) when \(0 < \lambda < (2\delta -1)\frac{1}{2\delta}\) (that is, when \(\lambda\) is ‘sufficiently smaller’ than its upper bound).</p>

And, finally, for agent \(C\) of degree \(4\), we have:

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(1) \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(4) = \lambda - \frac{2\delta - 1}{2}\) when \((2\delta -1)\frac{2 + \frac{2\delta-1}{2}}{2 + 2\delta - 1} \leq \lambda < 2\delta-1\) (that is, when \(\lambda\) is ‘sufficiently close’ to its upper bound);</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(1) \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(4) = \lambda - \frac{2\delta - 1}{2} + 1\) when \(0 < \lambda < (2\delta -1)\frac{2 + \frac{2\delta-1}{2}}{2 + 2\delta - 1}\) (that is, when \(\lambda\) is ‘sufficiently smaller’ than its upper bound).</p>

<p>Cases (1) above give the minimum number of companions necessary for the optimality of one’s preferred action when the idiosyncratic benefit \(\lambda\) is sufficiently strong; conversely, cases (2) provide the same condition when the benefit is sufficiently weak. It is easy to see that the only difference between the two cases is that, when the idiosyncratic benefit is (relatively) sufficiently weak—when an agent does not care that much about her preferred action—an extra companion is necessary for the optimality of the preferred action. Intuitively, and slightly overstated, in these cases the optimality of the preferred action runs through the interactional effect. It is also easy to see that, <cite>ceteris paribus</cite>, the higher one’s degree is—above, the more friends an agent has—the <cite>lower</cite> the necessary (minimum) number of companions is. (Recall that the upper bound \(2\delta-1\) is strictly positive.) In our running example, the more ‘popular’ an agent is—in the sense of having more friends—the <cite>easier</cite> it is for her to optimally follow her preferred action. This is a very interesting result that we will come back to below and that connects an agent’s (degree) centrality with her preferences—in fact, it is a small leap from here to further ask about the relation between an agent’s preferences and other types of centrality.</p>

<p>While the result above is interesting in its own right, recall that we were interested in the expressions for \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(d_{i})\) as a way of finding the conditions under which certain action profiles are equilibria. In coordination games, heterogenous profiles are much more interesting. (As in the standard non-idiosyncratic-utility setting, the two homogeneous profiles, where everyone takes either of the two actions, are equilibria, see part (i) of Theorem 1, 37.) Given the empirical heterogeneity of preferences, let’s assume that preferences are heterogenous so that at least some agents prefer different actions. Then, given a preference profile, the two types of possible heterogenous action profiles are then (1) the unique fully satisfying profile, where everyone performs their preferred action, and (2) frustrating profiles (note that all homogeneous profiles are, in this case, frustrating).</p>

<p>Orlova states the (very intuitive) condition for the existence of a fully satisfying equilibrium in coordination games in Theorem 2 (38). It says that each agent with degree \(d_{i}\) should have at least \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(d_{i})\) number of neighbours whose action preferences coincide with her own action preference (note the difference with a companion—a neighbour who performs, perhaps contrary to his preference, the respective agent’s preferred action). Thus, if an agent is of degree \(d_{i}\) and prefers drinking coffee (to tea), then she must have at least \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(d_{i})\) neighbours who also prefer drinking coffee (to tea). Put differently, ‘the distribution of idiosyncratic action preferences on a network is crucial for existence of a fully satisfying equilibrium’ (38), though the same is not necessarily true—that is, independently of the structure of the network—for frustrating (heterogenous) equilibria.</p>

<p>Consider the five-agent network with the preference profile we have seen so far (in <smallcaps>figure 2</smallcaps> and <smallcaps>figure 3</smallcaps>), and suppose that \(\delta=5/8\). The minimum-companion conditions above then become:</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">Degree \(1\):</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(1) \(l_{5/8,\lambda}(1) = \lambda + 1/4\) when \(1/12 \leq \lambda < 1/4\); for example, \(l_{5/8,1/6}(1) = 5/12 \approx^{\uparrow} 1\);</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(2) \(l_{5/8,\lambda}(1) = \lambda + 5/4\) when \(0 < \lambda < 1/12\); for example, \(l_{5/8,1/24}(1) = 31/24 \approx^{\uparrow} 2\).</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">Degree \(2\):</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(1) \(l_{5/8,\lambda}(2) = \lambda\) when \(1/5 \leq \lambda < 1/4\); for example, \(l_{5/8,9/40}(2) = 9/40 \approx^{\uparrow} 1\);</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(2) \(l_{5/8,\lambda}(2) = \lambda + 1\) when \(0 < \lambda < 1/5\); for example, \(l_{5/8,1/10}(2) = 11/10 \approx^{\uparrow} 2\).</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">Degree \(4\):</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(1) \(l_{5/8,\lambda}(4) = \lambda - 1/8\) when \(17/72 \leq \lambda < 1/4\); for example, \(l_{5/8,35/144}(4) = 17/144 \approx^{\uparrow} 1\);</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;">(2) \(l_{5/8,\lambda}(4) = \lambda + 7/8\) when \(0 < \lambda < 17/72\); for example, \(l_{5/8,17/144}(4) = 143/144 \approx^{\uparrow} 1\).</p>

<p>(Where \(\approx^{\uparrow}\) denotes rounding up to the nearest integer.)</p>

<p>Echoing Orlova’s observation above, we see that the underlying preference distribution plays a key role in determining whether the fully satisfying profile is an equilibrium. In particular, under the preference distribution assumed so far, the fully satisfying profile in the left panel of <smallcaps>figure 3</smallcaps> is <cite>not</cite> an equilibrium, as agent \(E\) (of degree one) needs agent \(C\) to be her companion for \(E\) to optimally follow her preferred action (drink coffee). Put differently, to have a <cite>fully</cite> satisfying equilibrium on this five-agent network, a necessary condition is for agent \(C\) to be \(D\) and \(E\)’s companion and hence for \(C\) to have the same preference as \(D\) and \(E\).</p>

<p>So, as Theorem 2 shows (38), there has to be some preference homogeneity or cohesion among neighbours for a fully satisfying profile to be an equilibrium. This might be a (rare) full preference homogeneity or a ‘clique-ish’ homogeneity as in the following example:</p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;"><img src="https://uzunovam.github.io/images/graph4.png" /></p>

<p style="padding-left:100px;"><smallcaps>figure 4</smallcaps></p>

<p>The left panel of <smallcaps>figure 4</smallcaps> is the same as the right panel of <smallcaps>figure 3</smallcaps>; the right panel of <smallcaps>figure 4</smallcaps> depicts the fully satisfying profile under a different preference distribution, with a preference ‘clique’ between agents \(C\), \(D\) and \(E\). In <smallcaps>figure 4</smallcaps>, as we have seen, \(\mathbf{x}\) is not an equilibrium; however, the preference ‘clique’ between \(C\), \(D\) and \(E\) ensures that \(\mathbf{y}\) is.</p>

<p>(Orlova’s analysis assumes a fixed underlying network; an interesting follow-up work that need not depart from the fixed-network case could provide a model of preference change, given a fixed network. Such work could be very fruitful for understanding preference conformation or ‘sour-grapes’ type of preference formation à la Jon Elster. For example, assume that agents care about (at least feeling like they are) staying true to their preference—agents exhibit, we might say, a <cite>genuineness bias</cite>. Then, a frustrating equilibrium imposes a (psychological) penalty that a satisfying one doesn’t. If agents adjust their preferences in a way that makes the optimality of being genuine more likely, then a dynamic model of preference change could explain how, and under what conditions, agents may move from an unstable to a stable fully satisfying equilibrium (say, from the left panel to the right panel of <smallcaps>figure 4</smallcaps>). Orlova’s analysis suggests that if such convergence is possible, the resulting preference distribution will exhibit a non-negligible degree of preference homogeneity, at least among neighbours—this, in turn, could explain the emergence of preference conformity through the interplay between interactional/idiosyncratic utility and a concern for genuineness. An at least <cite>prima facie</cite> surprising explanation as conformity is often contrasted with staying true to oneself or preferences.)</p>

<p>What about heterogenous frustrating equilibria? Consider a heterogenous profile, where at least two agents are taking different actions. Suppose that the two actions are (drinking) coffee and (drinking) tea. We may split, or partition, the set of agents into two disjoint sets: (1) those who choose coffee (\(S^{c}\)), and (2) those who choose tea (\(S^{t}\)). We may further split each of these sets into two subsets: those who are satisfied, given their action, and those who are frustrated. Thus, the set of coffee-drinkers \(S^{c} = S^{cc} \cup S^{ct}\) can be partitioned into the set of satisfied coffee-drinkers \(S^{cc}\) (who prefer coffee) and the set of frustrated coffee-drinkers \(S^{ct}\) (who prefer tea). Similarly, for the set of tea-drinkers \(S^{t} = S^{tt} \cup S^{tc}\). In part (ii) of Theorem 1 (37), Orlova shows that a heterogenous profile (including a frustrating profile) is an equilibrium if and only if the agents in the satisfied (\(S^{cc}\) and \(S^{tt}\)) and the frustrated (\(S^{ct}\) and \(S^{tc}\)) sets meet certain ‘connectivity’ conditions. More precisely, (1) all satisfied agents of degree \(d_{i}\) need to have at least \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(d_{i})\) neighbours who perform the same action (drink the same beverage), and (2) all frustrated agents of degree \(d_{i}\) need to have at least \(d_{i} - l_{\delta,\lambda}(d_{i}) + 1\) neighbours who perform the same action (drink the same beverage). Combining this with the observation about \(l_{\delta,\lambda}(d_{i})\) above, we may say that, <cite>ceteris paribus</cite>, the higher one’s degree is (the more ‘popular’ one is), the easier it is to be optimally satisfied and the harder it is to be optimally frustrated—it is easier (harder) for more ‘popular’ agents to optimally follow (go against) their preferences.</p>

<p>One implication of these conditions is that, given the ‘clique-ish’ preferences in the right panel of <smallcaps>figure 4</smallcaps>, there is <cite>no</cite> frustrating equilibrium that is heterogenous—frustrating equilibria must be homogeneous. To see why, suppose that \(\delta=5/8\) and \(\lambda\) is sufficiently high so that it takes one companion for the optimality of the preferred action across all degrees—say, \(\lambda = 35/144\). If \(E\) is frustrated (drinks tea), so must be \(C\) and \(D\). For the profile to be heterogenous, at least \(A\) or \(B\) must thus drink coffee (and also be frustrated)—since the agents are degree-symmetric, what is optimal for \(A\) is also optimal for \(B\), and vice versa. We must thus have the fully frustrating profile where the coffee-lovers \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\) drink tea, while the tea-lovers \(A\) and \(B\) drink coffee. Drinking coffee, however, is not optimal for \(A\) and \(B\), since for either of them to be frustrated, they need at least two neighbours drinking coffee as well. Similar reasoning takes care of the other possibilities.</p>

<p>There is thus an interesting interplay between the structure of the network and the underlying preference distribution that together determine whether a frustrating profile is an equilibrium. (In Figure 8, 43, Orlova gives an example where a heterogeneous frustrating equilibrium does exist.)</p>

<p>To get a feel for when heterogenous profiles may or may not be equilibria, let’s take an extreme case. Suppose that the matching benefit is maximally high, \(\delta=1\)—this implies that the idiosyncratic benefit may be of any strength strictly between zero and one. Consider the agents of degree \(1\) (agents \(D\) and \(E\)). When \(\delta=1\), the minimum number of companions necessary for the optimality of their preferred action is strictly larger than (at least) one (depending on how strong \(\lambda\) is)—since agents can’t come in non-integer numbers, we can round this minimum up to two. And since the single-degree agents have just one neighbour, there is no heterogenous (or homogeneous, for that matter) equilibrium where these agents choose their preferred action. So, when \(\delta=1\), in any heterogenous equilibrium, the single-degree agents must be frustrated, that is, they must have chosen their non-preferred action. (Intuitively, in such cases, the marginal benefit of matching, \(\delta=1\), is higher than the marginal idiosyncratic benefit, \(\lambda < 1\).)</p>


In coordination games, popular agents—agents with more connections—optimally follow their preferences more easily than less popular agents do.
